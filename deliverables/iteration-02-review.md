Q3. Planned changes

List any process-related (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

We planed to meet in-person every weekend to work together, but it's common that one or two of us were unavaialble. So we decided to hold all meetings online and record our Zoom meetings so that people who didn't come could review our project-related conversations and keep up with all the changes.

We planned to divid work into different section of the application, and each memeber are responsiable to compelete the section and resolve the problem along the way.  We noticed this kind of workflow is inefficient, since each memeber handles their own section, its very hard to get help from other members, as others need to take a long time to understand your code before they can figure out the problem. We changed our workflow to having 2-3 people to handle a bigger section(i.e. front-end, backend, database).  Then everyone will have a better understanding for the whole section they are reseponsable for, and can offer help to others when encounting blockers.
