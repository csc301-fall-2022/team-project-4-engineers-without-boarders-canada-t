Q3. Planned changes

List any process-related (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

We planed to meet in-person every weekend to work together, but it's common that one or two of us were unavaialble. So we decided to hold all meetings online and record our Zoom meetings so that people who didn't come could review our project-related conversations and keep up with all the changes.
