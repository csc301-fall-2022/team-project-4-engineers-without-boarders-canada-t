Q3. Planned changes

List any process-related (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

We planed to meet in-person every weekend to work together, but it's common that one or two of us were unavaialble. So we decided to hold all meetings online and record our Zoom meetings so that people who didn't come could review our project-related conversations and keep up with all the changes.

We intended to divide the work into distinct sections of the application, with each member responsible for finishing the area and fixing any issues that arose along the way. We found that this type of workflow is inefficient because each person is responsible for their own area. As a result, it is quite difficult to receive assistance from other members because it takes them a long time to grasp your code before they can identify the issue. We altered our process such that 2-3 individuals would manage a larger part (i.e. front-end, backend, database). Everyone will then be better equipped to understand the entire portion they are responsible for and be able to assist one another when facing obstacles.
