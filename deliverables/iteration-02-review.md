Q3. Planned changes

List any process-related (i.e. team organization and how you work) changes you are planning to make (if there are any)

We planed to meet in-person every weekend to work together, but it's common that one or two of us were unavaialble. So we decided to hold all meetings online and record our Zoom meetings so that people who didn't come could review our project-related conversations and keep up with all the changes.

We intended to divide the work into distinct sections of the application, with each member responsible for finishing the area and fixing any issues that arose along the way. We found that this type of workflow is inefficient because each person is responsible for their own area. As a result, it is quite difficult to receive assistance from other members because it takes them a long time to grasp your code before they can identify the issue. We altered our process such that 2-3 individuals would manage a larger part (i.e. front-end, backend, database). Everyone will then be better equipped to understand the entire portion they are responsible for and be able to assist one another when facing obstacles.


Q4. How was your product demo?
* How did you prepare your demo? \
\
Firstly, we did some internal demos to evaluate the level of presentation of the team's work on the project before showing it to the client. During these internal demo, we try to improve the demo on various aspects, for example, we added more visialization content, where we consider that texts and images are important for the client. Then, we finalized the process of demonstrate the working software and the explanation to the client on what we have done and what we haven't. Lastly, we decide to leave some time to the client to let them ask any questions related to the project.

* What did you manage to demo to your partner?\
\
We showed all the pages of the project that we currently done and all the features by now, for example, the multiple question page, the introduction/home page, and the main feature: the water filter simulator page. Although the UI is still simple and needed more polishing, but all the functionality works fine as demo goes. At last, we introduced some more feature that still need to be worked on and some ideas about features that can be add on the project.

* Did your partner accept the features?\
\
Yes, our partner is quite satisfied on what we have by now, the project seems on the right track as they give us plenty free space to let us work on the project.

* Were there change requests?\
\
Not much, only probably need more UI improvement on the overall software experience.

* What did you learn from the demo from either a process or product perspective?\
\
Practice is important. There will be a lot of situations that we cannot expect if we didn't do some internal demo before demoing to the partner. Also, we should be clear on what is important and what is not before the demo, only showing important part will make the demo easy to follow and demonstrate good dimplicity.
