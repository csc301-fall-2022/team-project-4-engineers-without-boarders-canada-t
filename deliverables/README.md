Development requirements
- There's no requirement regarding OS. As long as Android Studio is installed, a developer can clone our codes and build the project locally.
- If you want to run the actual application, you need to go to "Build" > "Build Bundle(s) / APK (s)" > "Build APK(s)". After an APK is built, you could install the application to any Android machine.
